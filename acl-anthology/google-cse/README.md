# Config files for Google Custom Search

These files provide the configuration for the Google Custom Search element on
the Anthology website.

`cse.xml` is the "context file" of the search engine and defines CSS styling as
well as different search facets (e.g., "Authors", "Paper Metadata") that appear
in the search.

`annotations.xml` associates labels used in `cse.xml` with parts of the website.

Both files can be uploaded from the "Advanced" tab of the Control Panel of the
Google Custom Search Engine.  Any administrator can upload `cse.xml`, but only
the owner (currently Matt Post) can upload `annotations.xml`.
